    <!-- 
    This is FizzBuzz exercise
        Rules:
    Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn.
    However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz.
    Numbers divisible by both three and five (i.e. divisible by 15) become fizz buzz.

        Pseudocode:
    1.Create a function that run a number from 1 to 100
    2.If a number can be divide by 3, replace it with the word 'Fizz'
    3.If a number can be divide by 5, replace it with the word 'Buzz'
    4.And if a number can both divide by 3 and 5, replace it with the word 'FizzBuzz'
